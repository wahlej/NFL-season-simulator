NFL Season Simulator

This program is intended to simulate a season of the NFL. The intention is not to be an accurate simulator, but one that still
takes player quality into consideration (teams with better players should attain more wins.) 

Below are the current plans for the program.

The program will starts with all 32 teams, including 5 players (QB, RB, WR, MLB or ILB, and CB), along with the coach. The players 
have ratings (typically between 70-99) which are taken from the current Madden ratings on the EA Sports Madden site (any rookies without 
ratings will be given a 75). The user will be able to edit all team info. During a game between two teams, each player will have either 
a Terrible, Bad, Average, Good, or Great game based on predetermined percentages based on their rating (percentages will be determined 
through testing to find a good balance). Each of these performances will have a value (1-5, with Terrible being 1 and Great being 5), 
and whichever team has the higher sum of performances will be the winner. A tie will simply result in a tie in both teams' records.

The NFL schedule will be randomly generated. There will be no preseason. The user will be able to simulate in amounts of one week, until
the end of the regular season, or through past the Super Bowl. The user will be able to check the teams' record at any time.
