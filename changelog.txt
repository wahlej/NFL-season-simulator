- Brainstorming idea for simulating games
    - Ratings from Madden for 5 key players (QB, WR1, RB1, MLB, CB1)
        - Players randomly have a "Terrible," "Bad," "Average," "Good," or "Great" games
            - Rating correlates with odds of each performance
            - Wins/losses increase/decrease rating minimally?

- Working on creating "Team" object with coach, each of the 5 players, team name/location
    - also creating player object

- For the Future: Need to figure out how to create a random schedule that works
